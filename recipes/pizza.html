    <h3>Description: </h3>
    <p>This is a double-rise dough typical of Neapolitan pizza. Two different rise methods are provided, one overnight in refrigerator and the other with a sponge.</p>
    <h3>Recipe: </h3>
    <p>This bread machine pizza dough is an easy recipe for anyone to try with just basic ingredients. If you love a good thin crust that still has a nice chew to it, this recipe is for you.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients. </li>
        <li>Pour warm water into the bread machine pan; add flour on top of water. Sprinkle over yeast, salt, and sugar. Set the machine on the dough setting, and push the start button. </li>
        <li>When the machine signals that the dough is finished, transfer dough to a well-floured work surface. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Roll or stretch dough out into a thin crust about 14 inches in diameter, leaving dough thick at the edge. Place dough onto a 14-inch pizza baking sheet; brush dough with olive oil. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes; remove and top with desired ingredients before final baking. </li>
    </ol>
